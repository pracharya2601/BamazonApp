<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>A table of all the products offered will be shown to the user with id number, product name, department name, price and stock quantity. </p>

<p>After inputting the id number, the next prompt would ask for the units.</p>

<p>Once the two prompts are answered, the selected product will be displayed by itself in one row for the user.</p>
